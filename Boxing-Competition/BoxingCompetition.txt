Problem

In a boxing competition, there are N teams, team i consists of Ai boxers. You need to line up the teams in the form of a circle, meaning that the first team is adjacent to the second team and the last team. In this competition, each time a team is selected they compete with the two neighboring teams, where many competitions take place. The teams compete in three-person competitions such that one person from each team will compete in all possible ways.
This means that suppose the team i was chosen to compete, the number of competitions will be (A((i-1)mod n) * Ai * A((i+1)mod n)) then team i is eliminated from the competition. After a team is eliminated, the two adjacent teams become adjacent to each other and this continues as long as there are at least three teams within the circle.
The director of the competition wants to choose the order of the teams that would start participating such that the largest possible number of competitions take place.
Your task is to find the largest possible number of competitions that take place assuming that the director picks the order of teams optimally.

3
Output
6
Output Description 
We can choose anyone and the answer will be 6.
1*2*3 = 6.

Input
4

4
5
5
Output
180
Output Description
First we will choose the third and the answer will increase by 5*5*4=100. Then the array will be like [4,4,5], then we can choose anyone and the answer will increase by 4*4*5=80 so the answer is 100+80=180.

Input

6
Output
192
Output Description
First, we will choose the third and the answer will increase by 4*5*6=120. Then the array will be like [3,4,6], then we can choose anyone and the answer will increase by 3*4*6=72. So the answer is 120+72=192.
